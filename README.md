###Problem:

My children have been virtual students for 3 years and have always dealt with issues getting assignment help within 48 hours; leaving them to continuely get behind.

With so many new families with virtual students, 48 hours will look fast tracked.

###Solution:

The Virtual Desk is an app for students to get help from teachers, assistants and tutors more efficiently. Not only will students be able to get help faster, it will also free the teachers from being the only available source for students to seek help.
